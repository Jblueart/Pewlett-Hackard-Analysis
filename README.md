# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis


Examining the employees and departments who have employees who will retire soon. 
This is helpful because we can plan and predict how many new employees we will need to replace our older workforce. 
The employees who plan to retire will have enough time to mentor some of the employees, candidates are listed on the mentor_eligible.csv sheet. 

## Prepping for the 'Silver Tsunami' 

 Since 33,117 people are eligible for retirement, we'll definitly need to increase our recruitment strategies as we only have 1548 individuals eligible for mentorship under the current program parameters. 


### Resources
Data Tools: PostgreSQL, pgAdmin 4



SQL language invites a robust analysis of the information. We're able to transform the data into actionable databases with valuable information. 
Because we're able to combine tables, we can create new reference sheets that allow for a deeper understanding. 

We've been unpacking Tables, and starting to understand the headers, as well as primary & foreign keys. 
We've identified the need for the primary keys to be Unique to each entry to maintain data integrity. 


### Entity Relationship Diagram
ERDs allow us to document and exdplore existing databases with a visual represtation. It helps to analyze and see the relationships between the various tables. 
Since ERDs show us how the data connects, they make it easier to interpret and manipulate the information into more clear databases.
